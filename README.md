This is a repository for the code developed to produce the results in the paper titled "Cognitive radio network with coordinated multipoint joint transmission" [DOI:10.1002/dac.3310](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3310/abstract)

The paper focuses on the interference analysis and channel allocation and scheduling scheme in a CoMP enabled CR network.

There is a short description at the beginning of each code depicting the function of the code.

To perform the channel allocation and scheduling 'main.m' has to be run
